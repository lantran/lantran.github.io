More and more people keep talking about Artificial Intelligence (AI) like
they used to talk about Cloud Computing. I, myself, don't like buzzwords
so I start spending time to learn about AI. This blog will summarize what
I collected so far about this subject. There are 2 helful videos which I
think can help you understand the subjects easily.
